Alex is a Computer science student, he alotted a job in intern, that he want to find the given IP is IPv4 or IPv6
Create a algorithm for finding the address.

Sample input:
172.16.254.1

Sample output:
IPv4

Explantion:
The IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dotted-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots (".")
so the given is IPv4

Sample Input:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

Sample output:
IPv6

Explantion:
The IPv6 addresses are canonically represented in ':' notation.
So the given is IPv6

Sample input:
192.168.254.01

Sample output:
-1

The given IP address is neither IPv4 or IPv6 so printing the output as -1.
